# Hyde Park Safety App
Scarlet Hacks 2017

## Inspiration
We often receive security alerts about crimes near the UChicago campus so we'd like to find safer walking routes, especially because our Masters classes are at night.

## What It Does (or what we had planned it to do)
It shows the emergency campus phones' locations and recent crime areas. It shows safe routes based on police reports, density of currently open stores, and user-reported suspicious activity.

## What's Next
Completing the features we had set out to add, including:
- A reporting feature for suspicious activity with user accounts for verification and spam prevention
- Finish the visualization with the data on crime activity we have have collected from various sources
- Fix the directions
- Complete heat map of open businesses and high traffic areas
- Creating a friend interface to find people to walk home with
